\chapter{\label{summary}Summary and Conclusions}



\begin{enumerate}
	\item We learned how the PID controller works.
	\item  We studied the PID controllers theoretical explanations.
	\item  We first implement the PID controller using the TCLab in python.
	\item  We observe the changes in how fast or slow the graph reach to its target with changing parameters.
	\item  We learned how multiSim works. 
	\item We implemented the PID controller in multiSim.
	\item  We observe the change in time to reach the target with changing the value of resistance in the circuit in multiSim.

{\bf ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
\end{center}

I sincerely thank \textbf{Prof. Pratap Kumar Sahoo} for granting me this opportunity to study
and simulate PID. 
From the core of my heart I am extremely thankful to \textbf{Dr. Gunda Santosh Babu} for providing the help and guidance while learning and simulating PID, without whom this developing the PID simulation might not be possible in  time.  Once again I thank him giving me invaluable knowledge and insight into the field and guiding me towards the proper direction each time I went astray.\\
Last but not the least I would like to thank my family, friends and PhDs who supported me way over emotionally . This noble work won't be fruitful without you people, I thank you all from my heart and tranquility.
